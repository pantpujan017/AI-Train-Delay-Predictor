## 📌 Overview
Train delays are a major issue affecting the railway industry. This project leverages **Machine Learning (ML)** to predict train delays based on historical data and operational parameters such as weather, congestion, and time of travel.

The **Streamlit-based web app** allows users to enter train details and receive real-time delay predictions.

## ✨ Features
- 📊 **Predict Train Delays** based on operational data
- ⚡ **Machine Learning Model** trained using **Random Forest**
- 🌦️ **Weather-based Analysis** to determine impact on train delays
- 🎛️ **Interactive UI** built with Streamlit
- 💾 **Real-time Predictions** using user-input values

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8**
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data processing
- **Scikit-Learn** for ML model training
- **RandomForestRegressor** for prediction
- **Streamlit** for the web interface
- **Joblib** for model storage
